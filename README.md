# MetaMask_Connection_FrontEnd_Tutorial
### I demonstrated how to connect MetaMask wallet to the frontend, detect account changing, and detect and switch the network (ChainID) in the web3 Dapps. You can change the targetNetworkId parameter with your desired network (chainID). You can also find a list of chainIDs from [chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)
